First day of journaling stuff!
Man, having a [WhiteHat](MIC/WhiteHat%20ICT/WhiteHat%20ICT.md) newsletter in this format would be convenient.

## Evening

## Afternoon  ‚áí Success!
Day of deep work so far‚Äîyay!!

### Uni Backroom DX, Late Paperwork
Finally added `Break Time` section to my custom MIC work study Excel form. After already being adopted by some staff/admin, this latest addition should make it irresistible‚Äîyay!!

### Levtech Meeting Mishaps
Forgot my Levtech College explanatory session. Realized right upon receiving 15:09 reminder call, and first words were„Äå„ÅÇ„ÅÅ„ÅÅÔºéÔºéÔºéÂøò„Çå„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„ÅüÔºÅÊõ∏È°ûË®òÂÖ•„ÅÆÊúÄ‰∏≠„Åß„Åô„Åå „Äç. Quickly opened calendar and scheduled meeting‚Äîbenefits of having five monitors.

A few minutes later, my Levtech Rookie agent called to deliver my first Ê±Ç‰∫∫Ê°à‰ª∂. My first sentence was a proper, fluid „Äå„ÅØ„ÅÑ„ÄÅÂÆÆÂ¥éÂõΩÈöõÂ§ßÂ≠¶„ÅÆ„Éü„É•„Ç¢„Éª„Ç®„É¥„Ç°„É≥„Åß„Åô„Äç‚Äî pretty proud of myself for that one. Scheduled meeting.

### Late Emails
Forgot to email VP about Venture Makers program. Did that during lunch. Glad I brought my Base Bread.

## Morning

### GLS
During class, made a good decision to stay on task during last fifteen-minute presentation prep time, contrary to what I told teacher. The deep-work mode sink takes time.  

### Wakeup, Work
Late to [Global Leadership Seminar](MIC/‰∏âÂπ¥/ÂæåÊúü/IDS312-1%20Global%20Leadership%20Seminar/IDS312-1%20Global%20Leadership%20Seminar.md) despite blocking extra departure prep time after working on late paperwork. Expected to finish paperwork, make classwork progress before class, but accomplished neither!

### Dorm Kitchen Kubuntu Update

With Isaac's help, upgraded a half-year out EOL (end-of-life) [Kubuntu](Kubuntu.md) setup.

Initially, around 9PM(?), we tried editing `sources.list` manually to update to the latest version of Kubuntu, but couldn't get it to work. Isaac tried his hand at it, and attempted to overwrite with Arch instead, but gave up at around 11PM.

I happened to swing around at 2AM to heat up my bento, and surfed the EOL upgrade page on Ubuntu Community. After a few minutes of copy-pasting repository URLs from there, I eventually found the distro upgrade tool at the bottom of the page.

Voil√†. Glad Ubuntu makes Linux life a bit easier.
